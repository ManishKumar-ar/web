////// substr()   ===> is deprected now, now we will use slice() in place of it.

let names = "manishkkkkk"
let ans = names.substr(2,5);              // it means starting from the index 2 and go to the length of 5
let ans2 = names.slice(2,5);             // it means starting from the index 2 and go to the index of 5.

console.log(ans);
console.log(ans2);

//output
// nishk
// nis
